3: Better to use fontSize value from a variable so that it can be replaced easily if required. Its not good idea to use inline styling, better import a style file and use a class selector.

7: Typo for the fuction name, it should be CarsFuel but not CarsFuuel, Props should be destructured in the parameters e.g. ({ children fuel }). Optionally an arrow function can be used for code brevity, but that depends of the style used in the rest of the project; Use memo to memoize the component, that will improve performance and will render the component only when props change.

8: Using <h1> for styling is against accessibility standards. Also to better show to the user the fuel consumption graphically use the <progress /> tag. 

11: Destructure props as ({ fuel }) Use memo to momoize the component; Use propTypes to describe what props your component expects and whether these comply to the expected type(s) check PropTypes

17: Using setState inside a useEffect can create infinite loop issue, instead you can use const hasAlert = fuel > 1200 in your JSX.

22: Using <h2> for styling purposes is against accessibility standards. Also utilise JSX as it is much cleaner and easier to read. Adding role="alert" will notify a screen reader that the fuel has changed as it will become live region; Printing All is fine is not in the acceptance criteria: e.g. return hasAlert && <div className={styles.danger)} role='alert'>Alert</div>

28: Since React v16 the best practices favour function components and hooks over class components and lifecycle methods. Main reason being performance and shouldComponentUpdate that usually leads to bugs. Use effect has a different mental model but provide greater flexibility; Use propTypes here as well;

34: Name your state variables with proper names as that would make your code readable for you and others after you const [{ position, fuel }, setState] = useState({ position: 1, fuel: 0 })

40: When calling setInterval don't forget to clean up after the components unmounts

  const intervalId = setInterval(() => {
    setState(prevState => ({
      position: prevState.position + 1,
      fuel: 1 + prevState.fuel + prevState.position * 10,
    })
  )}, 1_000)
  
  useEffect(() => () => {
    clearInterval(intervalId)
  }, [])
Also observe formatting, use eslint and prettier to auto format it.
